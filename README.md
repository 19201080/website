### **WEBSITE**  ###
My super cool website at [et-nd.co](http://et-nd.co).

----------

### Context ###
Recently, i have rebuilt my website from scratch. I wanted a site both simple and easy to maintain, but didn‚Äôt want to rely on a heavy cms. I developed this dynamic website where i can easily change the content through folders, and adapt the composition and grid to new elements using simple arguments in php. I tried to keep the interface design sober and without too much frills, so most of my js work is on the little details of navigation üêù

#### Improvements ####
PHP feels a bit old and cumbersome. So a big improvement would be to translate the backend to a node.js system. Another improvement, but a rather small one, is actually a big lesson i learned while doing this project. The sass library i have used, Compass, is no longer maintained. It‚Äôs had no incidence on my work, but if there ever is a bug, i will be on my own. So a second improvement would be to use Bourbon instead (and to always check if libraries are alive, of course).
