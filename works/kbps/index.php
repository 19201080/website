only sound. Instead, it is a sum of various sensations received through
the stage lights, the people moving around us, the temperature slowly rising, and so on. Nevertheless, each and every music format trying to encapsulate music the most accurately focuses on the quality of sound itself, but never on what is going on when we listen to music in real life.","col-4"),

Instead of consisting of sound channels only, it also includes four other channels, controlling domestic appliances: desk lamps, aquarium lights, fans, blenders, or even radiators. Each of these objects works as a scenographic element
to transform any home into a momentary concert venue, trying to make home listening a one-of-a-kind experience of light, sound, and even air.","col-4"),
